     Understanding Web Design & Development

  Web design and development is a process that includes a lot of elements to build a final website. For an example, in this website I have used HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  An easy way to understand what and how HTML, CSS and Javascript work together is thinking it as a house. HTML is the STURCTURE of the house, it is
  what you see when builders build the frame of the house. CSS is like the features and color. There may be painted walls or 
  things that makes your house <u>LOOK</u> better. Finally, Javascript are the things that has a job. For a house this could be the lights, faucets, fireplace or
  the microwave. All this applies the same for making a website.

  HTML, as you read earlier is the process where you lay the foundation. HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language" which means 
  using tags to describe what you want. There are different types of tags such as the paragraph tag. It looks like < > with a p in the middle
  This tells the computer that I just want normal text. Also, there is a closing tag which tells the computer when
  when to stop using that attribute. There are many more types of attributes you can use, such as the strong tag which tells thc computer to make the text bold.

  You may be thinking with just HTML it would just be a boring black and white website. This is where CSS comes in. CSS is the part of web design where you can put 
  colors and to make your website look better. Most of the time CSS tags start with the div tag which tells your computer to use the CSS attribute. Here are some examples
  of CSS properies. 
  <div style="float: center;"><img src="css graph.png"/> </div>
  One tip for CSS is when you try to put a bunch of div tags in a website it gets really confusing. For this reason there is a CSS class. A CSS class is 
  where you put all of your CSS properties in one place and can use it at a certain spot when needed. It's kind of like storing your stuff in a box.

  Javascript
  </div>

  <div class="p">
  <div style="color:green;">
  Javascript as I explained earlier is the part of a website that has a function or job. For an example, I used to Javascript to make a password page 
  for this website. Javascript tags use a script tag. In Javascript you may use variables to store information, if staments to have differnt scenarios and other attributes.
  You could make it possible so users can type stuff up on a website or if you click a hyperlink it will lead you to another part of the website.
